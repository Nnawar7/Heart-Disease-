# Heart-Disease
Problem Statement:
Apply logistic regression on the heart disease dataset according to the following rules:
1. Pick any two features from the dataset to test your logistic regression
2. You can apply logistics regression on several pairs of features to produce the highest
accuracy.
3. Visualize the 2d feature space to make sure that they are linearly separable
Deliverables:
1. Jupyter notebook showing detailed steps and visualization of different stages output
where Implementation of logistic regression training and prediction functionalities
from scratch (donâ€™t use libraries)
2. Please consider the following ideas for different experimental results such as: learning rate
change effect on accuracy, number of epochs change effect on accuracy, and effect of the
order of the samples on the final accuracy
